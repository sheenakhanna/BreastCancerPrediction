# BreastCancerPrediction

Used a data set containing info about cancerous and non-cancerous cells. The data set contained about 33 columns specifying various attributes such as radius_mean, perimeter_mean, texture etc

Started off by dropping columns with null values and some data visualisation using matplotlib and seaborn library and applying label encoding
Matplotlib is mainly deployed for basic plotting. Visualization using Matplotlib generally consists of bars, pies, lines, scatter plots and so on.
Pandas uses Matplotlib. It is a neat wrapper around Matplotlib. Seaborn is for more specific use cases. Also, it is Matplotlib under the hood. It is specially meant for statistical plotting.
